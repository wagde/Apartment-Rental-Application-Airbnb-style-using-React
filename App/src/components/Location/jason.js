    "generalDesc": "I live in the heart of Camden Town, in a late Georgian terrace of houses within a Conservation area, right in the centre of London. My flat is richly decorated which reflects the work that I do as a Textile Artist. My walls are covered with my choice of vintage finds, antiques and art. My Flat on 1st and 2nd Floor 16 sq mtrs: SITTING ROOM/BEDROOM: You will be staying (with me) in my sitting room on a comfy sofa bed. You will get complete privacy during your stay in my sitting room. This large sunny room has two big windows with wooden shutters and a big fire place. There will be fresh linen, a choice of pillows, towels, big duvets and hot water bottles. There is a hanger rail for your clothes. **I provide earplugs for you as I am on a main road. **1 extra small child can stay on AIR MATTRESSES or ONE EXTRA adult. This will be like CAMPING but is appreciated by families on a tight budget... or for a family for the weekend.",
    "guestAccess": "You have free Wi Fi, TV, DVD and information about what is going on in London, with maps and guidebooks. KITCHEN: You can use my kitchen whilst staying with me. There is unlimited tea and coffee, a washing machine, dishwasher, microwave, a fridge, iron and ironing board. I do not have an electric dryer - I hang clothes on a dryer in the hallway. **I don't supply breakfast but McDonald's ( 1 minute walk) has great food and Mario's is around the corner (with his own mini Art gallery). ** For 3 people to eat at the kitchen table is slightly tight... see the pictures. BATHROOM: You will be sharing the bathroom with me. I supply big towels, hairdryers and a few shampoos etc.",
